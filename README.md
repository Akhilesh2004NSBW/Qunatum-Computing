# Quantum State Simulation & Decoherence Engine

### *A Fully Custom Quantum Computing Simulator Built From First Principles Using Python & Linear Algebra*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a **complete quantum computing simulation engine**, implemented entirely **from scratch** using Python, NumPy, linear algebra, and core quantum mechanics principles.

No external quantum frameworks (Qiskit, QuTiP, Cirq) were used.

The simulator models:

* Qubits using complex vector mathematics
* Quantum superposition
* Measurement and state collapse
* Quantum gates (H, X, Y, Z, CNOT)
* Entanglement & Bell state generation
* Density matrix formalism
* Noise & decoherence using Kraus operators
* Bloch sphere visualization

The purpose of this project is deep understanding — not shortcuts.
Every transformation is implemented using **real physics & mathematics**.
